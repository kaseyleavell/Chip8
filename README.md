# Chip8
Telmac 1800 Emulator

# Description:
This is a true to hardware functioning emulator for the Chip8 processor running in the Telmac 1800. As of right now the emulator will only run the Pong rom that is in the directories. Functionality is being added to expand the rom input ability and give the user control over which game loads

Currently the Linux copy is the only workign copy. I have ran into trouble making the Visual Studio project transferable to other OSs. I am currently working on fixing this.

To check out the project navigate to the Chip8/Lin folder and follow the instructions in the README.

Thanks for checking out my project
